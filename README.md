# RJCP Framework

The RJCP Framework is a collection of libraries for use with other projects.

## Getting Started

### The Target Framework

The target frameworks are the Desktop version of .NET (version 4.0 to 4.8) and
.NET Core (.NET Standard 2.1).

### Documentation

Documentation is generally created using the Mark Down format. Look through the
directories for files ending with the extension `.md`.

### Compiling

Generally, the projects can be loaded and compiled with Visual Studio 2019. It
uses the `dotnet` tool for building.

### NuGet Packages

The output of the build in this repository are project binaries and NuGet
packages. You can use these NuGet packages in your own repositories. You
should *not* upload them to NuGet. If there will ever be a local NuGet server,
that information will be made available in the SCMP. Until then, get them from
SVN (see the SCMP) and use them in your project.
